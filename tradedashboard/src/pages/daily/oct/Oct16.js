                      U.S. stocks showed gains on Monday, as investors expressed
                      optimism that the Israel-Hamas conflict would not severely
                      impact the global economy. While tensions persisted in the
                      Middle East, there was relief that the situation had not
                      escalated into a more significant geopolitical crisis over
                      the weekend, prompting investors to move back into riskier
                      assets.

                      Investors remained concerned that an Israeli ground
                      invasion of Gaza aimed at Hamas could involve Iran,
                      potentially leading to stricter sanctions on Iranian oil
                      exports and higher energy prices. However, oil prices had
                      not seen a significant increase due to the conflict, with

                      lower-than-expected sales of its Covid-19 treatment and
                      vaccine. Pfizer also announced cost-cutting measures to

                      Analysts pointed out that optimism about the U.S. economy
                      could help offset concerns about geopolitical tensions.
                      Some Federal Reserve officials who had previously
                      considered another interest rate hike this year have
                      indicated that it might not be necessary due to the recent
                      rise in longer-term U.S. Treasury yields.

                      Federal-funds futures, used by traders to predict interest
                      rate direction, showed a 33% probability that the Fed
                      would raise rates again this year, down from nearly 50%
                      earlier in the month, according to CME Group data.
                      Meanwhile, the economy appeared to be on solid ground,
                      with the Atlanta Fed's GDP tracker estimating
                      third-quarter economic growth at a robust 5.1%.

                      broader markets, which has risen from its lowest level in
