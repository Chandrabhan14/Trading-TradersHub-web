                        Several important economic data releases are scheduled
                        for the week. The Census Bureau will release retail
                        sales data for September, providing insights into
                        consumer spending trends. Economists expect a 0.2%
                        month-over-month increase in retail sales. The National
                        Association of Home Builders will release its Housing
                        Market Index for October, offering insights into the
                        housing market's health. Analysts forecast a reading of
                        44. Additionally, the Census Bureau will report new
                        residential construction statistics for September,
                        including housing starts data, which is crucial for
                        assessing the real estate market's strength. The Federal
                        Reserve will release its Beige Book, a report
                        summarizing current economic conditions across the U.S.
                        This report gathers anecdotal information from the 12
                        regional Federal Reserve banks and provides valuable
                        insights into the state of the economy.

                      The Conference Board will release its Leading Economic
                      Index (LEI) for September. Economists are expecting a 0.4%
                      month-over-month decline in the LEI, matching the August
                      drop. The LEI has experienced 17 consecutive months of
                      declines, indicating potential economic challenges and the
                      possibility of a recession in the coming year. This
                      release will be closely watched by economists and
                      investors to gauge the economic outlook.

                    <p>
                      The National Association of Realtors will report
                      existing-home sales data for September. Economists are
                      forecasting a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 3.9
                      million homes sold, which represents a 3.5% decrease from
                      August. Existing-home sales data provide insights into the
                      real estate market's performance and consumer demand for
                      housing.
