                      Federal Reserve Governor Christopher Waller mentioned that
                      recent inflation data has been favorable and that if this
                      trend continues, it aligns with the Fed's inflation

                      Oil prices dropped as there were indications that the
                      Israel-Hamas conflict might not significantly disrupt oil
                      flows. Traders also monitored the possibility of
                      additional sanctions on Iran, which could impact oil
                      markets.

                      Despite higher inflation readings, the S&P 500 rose for a
                      fourth consecutive session. Mega-cap stocks performed
                      well, with Nvidia Corp. seeing a notable increase.
