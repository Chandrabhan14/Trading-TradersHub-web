                        Recent progress in bringing down inflation hit a
                        roadblock in September, indicating that the path to
                        fully extinguishing price pressures remains uncertain.
                        Good news: Price gains have significantly slowed from
                        last year's 40-year highs. Bad news: Core inflation,
                        excluding volatile food and energy prices, rose modestly
                        faster last month.

                      US consumer prices continued to rise briskly for a second
                      consecutive month, reinforcing the Federal Reserve's
                      commitment to maintaining high-interest rates to combat
                      inflation. The core consumer price index, excluding food
                      and energy costs, increased 0.3% in September, with the
                      overall CPI climbing 0.4% due to energy costs.

                      Stocks closed lower on Thursday, ending a four-day winning
