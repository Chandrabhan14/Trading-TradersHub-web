                      In the past week, U.S. stock indexes experienced a
                      significant rebound, marking their largest weekly gains of
                      2023 after recent declines had pushed the S&P 500 and
                      NASDAQ into correction territory. The NASDAQ surged by
                      6.6%, the S&P 500 gained 5.9%, and the Dow rose by 5.1%.
                      This turnaround was driven by several factors, including a
                      shift in the U.S. interest-rate outlook that led to a drop
                      in Treasury yields. Additionally, a moderation in job
                      growth in October suggested that the U.S. Federal Reserve
                      might delay further interest rate hikes. The Fed decided
                      to keep interest rates unchanged at its highest level
                      since 2001 for the second consecutive meeting, signaling
                      caution. October marked the third consecutive month of
                      negative performance for U.S. stock indexes, with the S&P
                      500 down 2.2% and the NASDAQ down 2.8%. However, the
                      strong performance of a select group of
                      technology-oriented companies prevented a more significant
                      decline in the S&P 500's overall year-to-date return.
                      Small-cap stocks, represented by the Russell 2000 Index,
                      saw a notable rebound of nearly 8% in a single week after
                      hitting a three-year low. Lastly, market volatility, as
                      measured by the Cboe Volatility Index, decreased
                      significantly as U.S. stocks regained ground.
